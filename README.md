# Job-Nest-Job-Portal-Project
JobNest is a modern and easy-to-use job portal that connects job seekers with employers. The platform has an easy-to-use interface that lets candidates sign up, make profiles, look at job listings, and apply for jobs that fit their skills and interests. Employers, on the other hand, can use a streamlined dashboard to post job openings, manage applications, and look for possible candidates. JobNest's main goal is to make the hiring process faster, easier, and less stressful for everyone involved. JobNest wants to make hiring easier by giving you better access to job opportunities and making them easier to find. It does this by letting you filter jobs, match profiles, and track applications. JobNest helps you move forward in your career, whether you're just starting out or have been working for a while.
